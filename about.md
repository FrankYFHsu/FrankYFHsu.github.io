Hi, I'm Yu-Feng Hsu. I received the PhD degree in communication engineering from the National Central University, Taiwan, in 2018.
My research interests include Delay tolerant networks/Mobile opportunistic networks, home networking technology, and Internet of Things. 
This is my blog for my learning notes.
